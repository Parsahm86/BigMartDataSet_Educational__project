# BigMart Sales Prediction

## 📌 Project Overview
This project aims to predict sales using the BigMart dataset.  
The workflow includes:
- Data preprocessing and cleaning  
- Sorting and numbering features  
- Feature engineering to improve ML performance  
- Model comparison (LinearRegression, SGDRegressor, etc.)  
- Hyperparameter tuning of the selected model  
- Model training and evaluation with different metrics  

## ⚙️ Requirements
- Python 3.x  
- pandas, numpy  
- matplotlib, seaborn  
- scikit-learn  

Install the required packages with:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🚀 Usage
1. Clone this repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/BigMart-Sales-Prediction.git
   cd BigMart-Sales-Prediction
   ```

2. Add dataset files into the `data/` folder.  

3. Run the notebook or script:  
   ```bash
   python src/train.py
   ```

## 📊 Results
- The pipeline will compare multiple models and select the best one.  
- Evaluation metrics: RMSE, MAE, R², etc.  
- The final report will summarize performance.
